<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;font-style: normal">Generic use cases</h3>
<p>We differentiate three general use cases for IaaS: Lift &amp; Shift, Improve &amp; Move, and Design &amp; Build</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;font-style: normal">Lift &amp; Shift</h3>

<p>One speaks of Lift &amp; Shift when it is unavoidable to move existing, traditional workloads into an IaaS cloud as unaltered as possible. As far as possible, management Tools for IT Operations are supported by the existing Data Centre Operation taken over and implemented. Cloud-native functions have little or no application. </p>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;font-style: normal">Improve &amp; Move</h3>

<p>One speaks of Improve &amp; Move if you adapt and modify IT processes in this approach to take advantage of cloud-native functions at least partially. You should use the migration process to achieve a more substantial standardization, a higher degree of automation, and free existing processes from legacy burdens. </p>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;font-style: normal">Design &amp; Build</h3>

<p>One speaks of Design &amp; Build if you redefine all or all new business and  IT processes. Further, you use agile, cloud-native methods in your developments wherever possible. Tools used are cloud-native, DevOps-oriented throughout the entire application operations and development life cycle, with a strong focus on automation and the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). </p>

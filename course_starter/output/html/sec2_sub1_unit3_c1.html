<h3 style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;font-style: normal">IaaS user profile</h3>
<p>IaaS users, in general, are looking for two significant benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>MORE DYNAMIC,
servers can be started and stopped as needed without the up-front cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REDUCED COMPLEXITY,
of buying, repairing, or dealing with physical hardware.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Organizations choose IaaS because it is often more comfortable, faster, and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without buying, managing, and supporting the underlying infrastructure. In addition, with IaaS, a business can rent or lease that infrastructure from another firm.</p>

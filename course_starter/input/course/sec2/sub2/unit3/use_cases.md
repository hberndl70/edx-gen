#### Developer

**Scenario**:
Since every failure of the online betting portal, brings an enormous loss of earnings, NoName Inc wants to build a more stable web presence with reduced or no downtime. Simultaneously, the web portal is enabled for many browsers to reach additional markets. Before releasing new web portal products to customers, all changes need testing in various browsers (Edge, Chrome Firefox, Safari, ...) to increase the overall stability. New development standards should help provide prompt feedback whenever a developer makes a change. In this way, the detection of problems is possible before releasing new products. Parallel execution of individual test scenarios enables quicker feedback to the developer, but require approximately 1200 servers temporarily for each test run. 

**Solution**:
EXOSCALE has several interfaces (REST API, Tool Integrations, e.g. Terraform), allowing a flexible and automatic deployment. Creating new servers is achieved within a few minutes. Execution and the afterwards decommission of used test-serves are done in no time. 

**Advantages**:
The high degree of automation provided by EXOSCALE makes such a modern and performant test scenario possible. The expensive acquisition of servers, which are only needed for a short time every day, or the company's often complex internal procurement processes, are eliminated with this solution. With the Pay-Per-Use principle, the customer is charged only for used resources by the second of the server loads executed. 


#### Enterprise

**Scenario**: 
The young software company NoName Ltd wants to simplify joint digital team collaboration utilizing video chat. The platform should offer teams with little effort a high-performance and straightforward solution to discuss open topics together daily. The new developed and patented streaming algorithm led to massive performance improvement. Integrations to task management,
CRM and knowledge base systems additionally facilitate team collaboration during a digital meeting. The platform uses a separate server for each meeting, and the server is needed in the timeframe when the meeting takes place. Depending on the requests, a strongly varying number of servers may be necessary.

**Solution**: 
Due to the excellent integration of tools that allow the creation, configuration, and control of the infrastructure, EXOSCALE offers an ideal foundation to meet the servers' flexible requirements. Thus, NoName Ltd can provide infrastructure fast, automated, and can remove quickly and also automated if not needed any longer. 

**Advantages**:
Due to the need for the flexible number of servers, NoName Ltd would have to purchase a pool of servers for the platform, which is at least as large as the expected maximum. EXOSCALE flexibility contributes crucially to the risk minimization and resources management by providing infrastructure components in a Pay-Per-Use model billed by the second. If more customers decide to use the platform, it is easy to create more servers for digital meetings. 


#### Science

**Scenario**: 
A new and modern image analysis-algorithm developed by NoName LLC should ensure the high weekly production volume's product quality. A considerable amount of high-performance computing resources is required to ensure the algorithm's quality and timely completion of the machine learning training phase. NoName LLC wants to offload the complexity associated with this task and does not wish to operate or purchase any servers itself.

**Solution**: 
EXOSCALE provides modern GPU instances optimised for advanced computational tasks like machine learning, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. 

**Advantages**: 
Outsourcing the complexity of the needed infrastructure configuration and using the high-cost hardware equipment in a Pay-Per-Use model, delivers many operational advantages at once. The GPUs architecture has simpler calculation units, but many of them perform more calculations per time to optimise e.g. machine learning performance.

IaaS users, in general, are looking for two significant benefits:

* MORE DYNAMIC,
servers can be started and stopped as needed without the up-front cost.

* REDUCED COMPLEXITY,
of buying, repairing, or dealing with physical hardware.

Organizations choose IaaS because it is often more comfortable, faster, and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without buying, managing, and supporting the underlying infrastructure. In addition, with IaaS, a business can rent or lease that infrastructure from another firm.

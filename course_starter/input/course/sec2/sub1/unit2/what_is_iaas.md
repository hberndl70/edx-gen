IaaS stands for **I**nfrastructure **a**s **a** **S**ervice and is the cloud computing service model for control freaks ;)

With the IaaS service model, you influence how you use cloud computing and configure your infrastructure compared to the other central cloud service models, Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS comprises a collection of physical and virtualized resources that provide you with the basic building blocks needed to run applications and workloads in the cloud.

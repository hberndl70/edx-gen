Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure provisioned and managed over the internet. It's one of the three basic types of cloud service models, along with Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). 

Comparisons, analogies, visualizations, and more can be found, so there is a solution to understand the cloud computing models for every need.

Just do some research on your own to find a different explanation or visualization. Sounds complicated, it isn't. Do a Google search (or use your preferred search engine) to look into the vast repository of explanations on the internet.
